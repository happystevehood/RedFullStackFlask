    <h4>Discalimer</h4>
    <p>
        This site was created by a 2024 participant whoâ€™s already signed up for the 2025 competition. 
        The author of this site has no official connection to Redline Fitness Games and developed this tool as a personal project, 
        so if there are any mistakes or issues its all my fault. Please dont complain to the Redline Fitness Games Organisers. It's all my fault.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Unfortunately not all events are available on this website such at the 2024 Day 1 Beginers Race, as the timing chip results were not so consistent. 
        Also I have not included all competitors as some of the chip timings were missing or incorrect. I've done the best I could to estimate results. If 
        your name is specificaly missing please request in the feedback form and I'll see what I can do to add it.
    </p>
