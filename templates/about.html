    <h2>About This Personal Project</h2>

    <p>
    The Redline Fitness Games is a high-intensity fitness competition featuring athletes from around the world. This unofficial 
    archive provides searchable, filterable access to Redline results, athlete stats, and event categories from 2023 and 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tool was built to help competitors and fans of the Redline Fitness Games explore past event results more efficiently.
        All data was originally published on Racetec Results and was extracted for visualization and personal analysis.
    </p>

    <h4>Technical Notes</h4> 
    <p>
        Results were manually copied into Excel from the public race timing site and then converted to CSV files per event.
        This site uses Flask, jQuery, Bootstrap, and DataTables to provide a fast and responsive experience.
        It was initially modeled on the 2023 result format and later updated for 2024.
