    <h2>About This Personal Project</h2>

    <p>
    The Redline Fitness Games is a high-intensity fitness competition featuring athletes from around the world. This unofficial 
    archive provides searchable, filterable access to Redline results, athlete stats, and event categories from 2023 and 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tool was built to help competitors and fans of the Redline Fitness Games explore past event results more efficiently.
        All data was originally published on Racetec Results and was extracted for visualization and personal analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        The original race result pages are available from <a href="https://runnersunite.racetecresults.com/" target="_blank">Racetec Results</a>, 
        and the official Redline Fitness Games website can be found at 
        <a href="https://redlinefitnessgames.com/" target="_blank">redlinefitnessgames.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>
        This site was created by a 2024 participant whoâ€™s already signed up for the 2025 competition. 
        The author of this site has no official connection to Redline Fitness Games and developed this tool as a personal project, 
        so if there are any mistakes or issues its all my fault. Please don't complain to the Redline Fitness Games Organisers. It's all my fault.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Unfortunately not all events are available on this website such at the 2024 Day 1 Beginners Race, as the timing chip results were not so consistent. 
        Also I have not included all competitors as some of the chip timings were missing or incorrect. I've done the best I could to estimate results. If 
        your name is specifically missing please request in the feedback form and I'll see what I can do to add it.
    </p>

    <h4>Technical Notes</h4> 
    <p>
        Results were manually copied into Excel from the public race timing site and then converted to CSV files per event.
        This site uses Flask, jQuery, Bootstrap, and DataTables to provide a fast and responsive experience.
        It was initially modelled on the 2023 result format and later updated for 2024.
