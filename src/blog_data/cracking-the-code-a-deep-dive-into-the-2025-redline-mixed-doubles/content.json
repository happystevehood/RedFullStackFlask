    "text": "<section>\r\n<p>The Redline '25 Mixed Doubles was the most popular event of the weekend, a whirlwind of strategy, teamwork, and raw effort with nearly 487 pairs hitting the start line. From the outside, it looked like pure chaos. But from the inside, the data tells a fascinating story of what it *really* took to succeed. While no single station dominated the race, the data shows that a strong performance on the <strong>Deadball Burpees</strong>, <strong>Sandbag Gauntlet</strong>, <strong>Row</strong>, and the new <strong>Shuttle Runs</strong> were highly correlated with a top finish.</p>\r\n<p>Let's break down the numbers and see what secrets they hold for your next race.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>The Lay of the Land: A Race of Youth and Grit</h4>\r\n<p>As the event with the most participants, the competitive energy was palpable. The podium was dominated by the 16-39 age group, showcasing incredible speed and power, though a formidable 40-49 pair impressively secured a third-place finish. The data also highlighted the immense challenge of the course for the 50+ athletes, who, while demonstrating incredible heart, consistently found the Sandbag Gauntlet to be a major hurdle.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure1.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Overall Time Distribution for Redline '25 Mixed Doubles by Age Group\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 1: This event was dominated by the 16-39 age group, with the Sandbag Gauntlet proving a tough challenge for the 50+ pairs.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>The Median Experience: Where Was Time Spent?</h4>\r\n<p>For the average pair (those finishing in the 45%-55% median group), the race was defined by cardiovascular endurance. The new <strong>Shuttle Runs</strong> and the trusty <strong>Row</strong> were, on average, the longest stations, demanding a huge engine. In contrast, the <strong>Russian Twists</strong> proved to be the quickest station, offering a brief moment to catch a breath before the next challenge.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure2.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Median Performance Times for each station in Mixed Doubles '25\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 2: Shuttle Runs and the Row took the longest, while Russian Twists were the shortest for the median team.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>The Strategist's Guide: Where to Win (or Lose) the Race</h4>\r\n<p>This pacing guide, initially built to help Bangkok competitors, reveals a crucial insight: not all stations are created equal. The events with the largest time difference between the top 10% and bottom 90% of athletes are where you have the biggest opportunity to make up ground. For the Mixed Doubles, the <strong>Squat Thrusts</strong>, <strong>Sandbag Gauntlet</strong>, and <strong>Row</strong> showed the widest variability. If you're looking for where to focus your training, start with these \"separator\" stations.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure3.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Station Pacing Guide for Redline '25 Mixed Doubles\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 3: Stations with the steepest curves represent the biggest opportunities to gain or lose time.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>A Tale of Two Halves: Pacing Under Pressure</h4>\r\n<p>For extra spice, let's analyze the performance of a specific top team, \"The D's.\" In the first half of the race, the time distributions for stations like the Run are quite narrow\u2014not much separates the fastest from the slowest. However, the gap widens significantly for the Deadball Burpees. Our example pair shows excellent timings but could perhaps improve on the Ski. Were they saving their powder for later?</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure4.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Time Distributions for Stations 1-6 for 'The D's'\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 4: A look at the first six stations shows where the pack starts to separate.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>In the second half, the impact of fatigue becomes obvious. The distributions for the <strong>Sandbag Gauntlet</strong>, <strong>Row</strong>, and <strong>Squat Thrusts</strong> are incredibly wide, as pacing breaks down across the field. This is where our example team shone, posting very strong times on these crucial, late-race stations, proving their endurance and strategy paid off.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure5.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Time Distributions for Stations 7-12 for 'The D's'\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 5: The second half shows how fatigue creates huge time gaps on key stations.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>The Nitty-Gritty: A Percentile Breakdown</h4>\r\n<p>This bar chart gives us another way to view performance. \"The D's\" are fairly consistent, but it also highlights a known issue in mass participation events: some of the recorded times for Farmer's Carry and Russian Twists are nearly impossible. This is likely due to an inability to count to 3 under duress\u2014a good reminder that even simple tasks become hard under fatigue!</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure6.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Performance vs. Time Percentiles for 'The D's'\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 6: A look at performance bands highlights consistency and potential data quirks from the race.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>The Final 65 Seconds: Your Path to the Top 10</h4>\r\n<p>For me, this is the most powerful chart. It compares an athlete's performance directly against the 24 pairs who finished within +/- 5% of their net time. It shows exactly where you won or lost time against your direct competition. To crack the Top 10, \"The D's\" would have needed to find another 65 seconds. A huge chunk of that could have come from improving their Ski and Sled times. This is the kind of specific, actionable insight that transforms training.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n<img src=\"/blog/image/cracking-the-code-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-redline-mixed-doubles/thumb_Figure7.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Station Time Difference vs. Similar Finishers for 'The D's'\">\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 7: This chart shows exactly where this team needs to improve to climb the leaderboard.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n<h4>Conclusion: Stop Guessing, Start Analyzing</h4>\r\n<p>The 2025 Mixed Doubles was a war of attrition won by strategy and endurance. The data provides a clear roadmap for what it takes to be competitive. Ready to see what your personal data story looks like?
