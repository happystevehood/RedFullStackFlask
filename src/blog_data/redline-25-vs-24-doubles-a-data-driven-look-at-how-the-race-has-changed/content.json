But what if the game itself has changed? Let's start by looking at the station changes for all Doubles categories.</p>\r\n        <p>Out go the 'Pendulum Shots', 'Battle Ropes', and 'Agility Chamber'. Looking at the data from the '24 Mixed Doubles, this is a significant shift. 'Pendulum Shots' was one of the toughest and most variable stations where a lot of time could be won or lost, while the 'Agility Chamber' was generally one of the faster and less differentiating stations for most. The 'Battle Ropes' fell somewhere in between.</p>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Figure 1: Mixed Doubles Station Breakdown from 2024 -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure1.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Station Changes for Redline 2025\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 1: The '24 stations being replaced by new movements for '25.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n\r\n        <p>The new stations \u2013 'Shuttle Runs', 'Russian Twists', and 'Squat Thrusts' \u2013 seem to pivot away from pure strength or specific skills towards more cardio-focused, muscular endurance challenges. 'Shuttle Runs' will introduce opportunities for fast-paced sprinting and quick transitions for agile pairs. And let's not forget the 'Deadball Burpee', which has a standard change: a lower throw height might seem easier, but this is balanced by a higher rep count, shifting the focus from pure strength to relentless endurance.</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n        <h2>Mixed Doubles: Lighter Loads, Faster Race?</h2>\r\n        <p>Let's start with the Mixed Doubles, which seemed to be the most popular doubles race of '24. For 2025, it looks like it might have gotten easier... if you like cardio! The need for top-end strength has been reduced, with weights on the 'Deadball Burpees', 'Farmer's Carry', 'Sandbag Gauntlet', and the 'Sled' all getting lighter, as you can see in the comparison below.</p>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Figure 2: Mixed Doubles Stations 2024 vs 2025 comparison table -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure2.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Mixed Doubles '24 vs '25 Station Changes\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 2: A comparison of weights and reps for Mixed Doubles between 2024 and 2025.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n\r\n        <p>With the demanding 'Pendulum Shots' gone and the 'Sandbag Gauntlet' getting lighter, it looks like the 2025 Mixed Doubles could be a cardio-based sprint to the finish... haha, maybe! The new conditioning stations will surely test everyone's engine.</p>\r\n        \r\n        <!-- Figure 3: Marked-up 2024 Mixed Doubles Bar Chart -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure3.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Analysis of 2024 Mixed Doubles times with 2025 changes noted\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 3: A look at the '24 Mixed Doubles time distribution with the '25 weight changes highlighted.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n        <h2>Women's & Men's Doubles: The Challenge is UP!</h2>\r\n        <p>While the Mixed Doubles might have gotten lighter, it looks like the Women's and Men's Doubles categories got tougher! For both divisions, the theme is clear: more volume, more work.</p>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Figure 4: Women's Doubles Stations 2024 vs 2025 comparison table -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure4.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Women's Doubles '24 vs '25 Station Changes\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 4: The Women's Doubles category sees increased calories and distances for 2025.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n        \r\n        <p>The Women's Doubles athletes will face extra calories on the Ski and Bike, a longer Farmer's Carry, more extra calories on the Row, and a heavier Mule carry. While the Sandbag Gauntlet remains a key differentiator, the extra work on all three erg machines (+5 cals each) will make for a tough threshold challenge across the board.</p>\r\n        \r\n        <!-- Figure 5: Marked-up 2024 Women's Doubles Bar Chart -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure5.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Analysis of 2024 Women's Doubles times with 2025 changes noted\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 5: How the '25 changes might impact the time distribution for Women's Doubles.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n\r\n        <p>Now for the Men's turn, the least popular of the doubles races... there's a joke in there somewhere! The Men's Doubles is changing similarly to the Women's: it's going to be tougher. Expect more calories and a longer Farmer's Carry, making endurance a key factor.</p>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Figure 6: Men's Doubles Stations 2024 vs 2025 comparison table -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure6.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Men's Doubles '24 vs '25 Station Changes\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 6: The Men's Doubles category also ramps up the volume for 2025.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n        \r\n        <p>The Sandbag Gauntlet will likely remain one of the tougher stations, but the now-longer Farmer's Carry is poised to be a major differentiator. The Row and Ski are swapping places in the 2025 station order, but the increased calorie demands mean the ergs will be even more significant than they were in '24.</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Figure 7: Marked-up 2024 Men's Doubles Bar Chart -->\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-vs-24-doubles-a-data-driven-look-at-how-the-race-has-changed/thumb_Figure7.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Analysis of 2024 Men's Doubles times with 2025 changes noted\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 7: How the '25 changes might impact the time distribution for Men's Doubles.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n\r\n    <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n        <h2>Conclusion: It's Cardio Season!</h2>\r\n        <p>So, to summarize: the new stations are more cardio-focused across the board. The Mixed Doubles has dropped some significant weights, likely leading to a faster, more furious race. Meanwhile, the Women's and Men's Doubles categories are upping the ante with increased cardio demands and longer, tougher carries.</p>\r\n        <p>That's it! Time to put on your best cardio shoes, work on that engine, and practice your sprint finishes. Good luck!</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"text-center font-italic\">Want to see how you stacked up in past events?
