    "text": "<p>With Redline Fitness Games 2025 just two months away, it's peak strategy season for Mixed Team Relay squads (2 Males, 2 Females)! The key to success often lies in smart team composition and, crucially, assigning the right athlete to the right leg. Each member tackles three unique, consecutive stations &ndash; so how do you decide who goes where? At Redline Fitness Results, we're using '24 Mixed Team Relay data to provide evidence-based guidance for your '25 lineup.</p>\r\n<p>As you finalize your team and training, remember that practicing with competition-spec equipment and simulating transitions is vital. This analysis will help you match your teammates' strengths to the specific demands of each relay leg in 2025.</p>\r\n<p>(All the graphs shown below, and more for the '24 Mixed Team Relay, are available by <a href=\"/display?eventname=TeamRelayMixed2024\">clicking here</a>.

This tells us that the athletes on these legs faced significant work periods. For '25, these stations remain, making Member 1 and Member 4 pivotal.</p>\r\n<h4>Figure 2: Where Can Your Team Make (or Lose) the Most Time? ('24 Mixed Relay Spreads)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/ace-your-redline-2025-mixed-relay-data-driven-team-leg-selection/thumb_img_20250526111529518007_0.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: '24 Mixed Team Relay Bar Station Breakdown (Time Spread) - click to expand\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 2: '24 Mixed Team Relay Bar Station Breakdown (Time Spread)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Large time spreads on stations like '24 Deadball Burpee (Leg 1) and Sled Push Pull (Leg 4) indicate these are 'separator' stations. The athlete you place on these legs needs to be resilient and efficient, as there's a lot of potential for time variation.</p>\r\n<h4>Figure 3: Distribution Insights with Violin Plots ('24 Mixed Relay)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/ace-your-redline-2025-mixed-relay-data-driven-team-leg-selection/thumb_img_20250526111529788928_1.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: '24 Mixed Team Relay Violin Station Breakdown - click to expand\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 3: '24 Mixed Team Relay Violin Station Breakdown</strong></p>\r\n<p>The violin plots for '24 Deadball Burpee, Sled Push Pull, and Sandbag Gauntlet show wide distributions. This means that while some athletes excelled, many found these challenging. Choosing athletes who are strong and consistent on the '25 equivalents for these demanding legs is crucial.</p>\r\n<h4>Figure 4: Connecting Station Strength to Team Success ('24 Mixed Relay Correlation)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/ace-your-redline-2025-mixed-relay-data-driven-team-leg-selection/thumb_img_20250526111530070232_3.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: '24 Mixed Team Relay Station Correlation with Total Time - click to expand\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 4: '24 Mixed Team Relay Station Correlation with Total Time</strong></p>\r\n<p>In '24, Sled Push Pull (Leg 4), Ski (then Leg 4, now Leg 1 in '25), and Row (Leg 1) had the highest correlation with overall team success. This emphasizes the importance of strong performances at the very start and very end of the relay.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Assigning Your Dream Team for Redline 2025 Mixed Relay:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Based on the '24 data and the confirmed 2025 Mixed Team Relay leg order (2 Males, 2 Females &ndash; assign gender strategically based on station weights/demands where M/F standards differ):</p>\r\n<p><strong>Leg 1: Run (500m) -&gt; Ski (30cal Mixed) -&gt; Deadball Burpees (25 reps, M/F weights, 175cm/200cm throw)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>'24 Learnings:</strong> Row (similar to Ski in demand) was critical, and Deadball Burpees had huge time spreads and high average time.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ideal Athlete Profile for Leg 1:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A strong, consistent runner to set a good initial pace.</li>\r\n<li>Excellent SkiErg capacity and technique &ndash; this athlete needs a powerful engine.</li>\r\n<li>Highly efficient at Deadball Burpees; resilient to high-rep metabolic work. This station can create big gaps early on.</li>\r\n<li>Consider placing an athlete here who recovers quickly to hit the Ski hard after the Run.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Leg 2: Bike (30cal Mixed) -&gt; Farmer's Carry (240m, M/F weights) -&gt; Shuttle Runs (40 reps)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>'24 Learnings:</strong> Farmer's Carry showed moderate correlation and can be a strength-endurance test.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ideal Athlete Profile for Leg 2:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Powerful cyclist who can hit calorie targets quickly.</li>\r\n<li>Exceptional grip strength, strong core, and robust carrying endurance for the *longer* 240m Farmer's Carry.</li>\r\n<li>Agile, fast, and good at quick changes of direction for the Shuttle Runs. This leg demands a good all-rounder with specific carry strength.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Leg 3: Russian Twists (100 reps, M/F weights) -&gt; Sandbag Gauntlet (1x20 Squats &amp; 20m Lunges, M/F weights) -&gt; Row (30cal Mixed)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>'24 Learnings:</strong> Sandbag Gauntlet was a high-variability, high-correlation station. Row was also key.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ideal Athlete Profile for Leg 3:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Solid core endurance and stamina for high-rep Russian Twists.</li>\r\n<li>Strong legs and mental toughness for the Sandbag Gauntlet (squats and lunges under load).</li>\r\n<li>Good rowing technique and capacity, especially after two demanding stations. This leg is a true test of grit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Leg 4: Squat Thrusts (80 reps Mixed) -&gt; The Mule (70m &amp; 130m, M/F weights) -&gt; Sled Push &amp; Pull (60m, M/F weights)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>'24 Learnings:</strong> Sled Push Pull and Ski (now on Leg 1) were the highest correlators with overall success. The Mule combines carries with running, similar to elements of '24.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ideal Athlete Profile for Leg 4 (Your Anchor!):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explosive power and muscular endurance for 80 Squat Thrusts.</li>\r\n<li>Exceptional strength and endurance for The Mule's varied sandbag carries over distance.</li>\r\n<li>Your strongest, most powerful athlete for the Sled Push &amp; Pull. This leg is often where races are won or lost. Needs an athlete who can empty the tank.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Gender Assignment Strategy:</strong> For Mixed Teams, carefully review the M/F standards for Deadball Burpees, Farmer's Carry, Russian Twists, Sandbag Gauntlet, The Mule, and Sled Push &amp; Pull. Assign your male and female athletes to legs where their strengths align best with the specific demands placed on their gender for those stations.</p>\r\n<h5>Final Two Months: Strategic Team Prep!</h5>\r\n<p>In these crucial final weeks:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Simulate Relay Legs:</strong> Have team members practice their assigned 3-station blocks, including transitions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Master Equipment &amp; Standards:</strong> Ensure everyone is comfortable with the '25 equipment and movement standards *for their gender* on their assigned stations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid the 10-Min Penalty:</strong> Every athlete MUST be able to complete their stations. This penalty can sink a team's efforts.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Leverage the data on <a href=\"/leaderboard\">Redline Fitness Results</a> to refine your team strategy. Every decision counts!
