So, the Redline Results team fired up the data engine to create a forecast for the 2025 Singles events!</p>\r\n        <p><strong>A Health Warning:</strong> This comes with a big disclaimer! These predictions are our best effort, based on analyzing past performance data and the new 2025 rulebook. We encourage you to use this as a guide and make your own predictions before the big day! \ud83d\ude09</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n        <h2>The Prediction Summary</h2>\r\n        <p>First, let's get straight to the results. Based on our analysis, here are the predicted ~Median Times for the 2025 Singles categories compared to their 2024 counterparts. The \"Median Time\" is calculated as the average finish time of athletes who placed in the 45th-55th percentile of their event.</p>\r\n        \r\n        <!-- Table of Predictions -->\r\n        <div class=\"table-responsive my-4\">\r\n            <table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped text-center\">\r\n                <thead class=\"thead-dark\">\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <th scope=\"col\">'24 Event</th>\r\n                        <th scope=\"col\">Actual ~Median Time</th>\r\n                        <th scope=\"col\">'25 Event</th>\r\n                        <th scope=\"col\">Predicted ~Median Time</th>\r\n                        <th scope=\"col\">Predicted % Change</th>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                </thead>\r\n                <tbody>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Women's Competitive Singles</td>\r\n                        <td>38:43</td>\r\n                        <td>Women's Level 3 (Advanced)</td>\r\n                        <td><strong>44:27</strong></td>\r\n                        <td class=\"text-danger\"><strong>+15%</strong></td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Men's Competitive Singles</td>\r\n                        <td>44:25</td>\r\n                        <td>Men's Level 3 (Advanced)</td>\r\n                        <td><strong>47:22</strong></td>\r\n                        <td class=\"text-danger\"><strong>+7%</strong></td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Women's Open Singles</td>\r\n                        <td>35:09</td>\r\n                        <td>Women's Level 2 (Intermediate)</td>\r\n                        <td><strong>44:54</strong></td>\r\n                        <td class=\"text-danger\"><strong>+28%</strong></td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Men's Open Singles</td>\r\n                        <td>36:57</td>\r\n                        <td>Men's Level 2 (Intermediate)</td>\r\n                        <td><strong>45:09</strong></td>\r\n                        <td class=\"text-danger\"><strong>+22%</strong></td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                </tbody>\r\n            </table>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <p class=\"small text-muted\"><em>You can find actual median time calculations (and various other pacints) for all past races on Redline Results by selecting your event and choosing the \"Pacing Table 'Actual'\" option.</em></p>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n        <h2>How Are These Predictions Made?</h2>\r\n        <p>How do we arrive at these numbers? It involves a bit of data analysis and some educated guesstimation, especially for the brand new stations. To do these calculations, you first need to look at the station-by-station changes for the event you are analyzing and estimate what impact those changes will have on the station time. You work your way through all the stations to build a complete event prediction. The most difficult part is forecasting the new movements for '25: the 'Shuttle Runs', 'Russian Twists', and 'Squat Thrusts'.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 class=\"mt-4\">Women's Level 3 (Advanced) vs. '24 Competitive</h4>\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-time-predictions-a-data-driven-forecast-for-singles-events/thumb_Figure1_blog.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Women's Level 3 vs 2024 Competitive Changes\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 1: Changes for Women's Level 3. Based on our analysis, we predict the median time will increase by 16% to 44:49.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n\r\n        <h4 class=\"mt-4\">Men's Level 3 (Advanced) vs. '24 Competitive</h4>\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-time-predictions-a-data-driven-forecast-for-singles-events/thumb_Figure2_blog.png\" alt=\"Men's Level 3 vs 2024 Competitive Changes\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 2: Changes for Men's Level 3. Our analysis predicts a 7% increase in median time to 47:22.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n       <p> So how do you apply this? Let me take myself as an example in Men's Single Competitive '24 I had a near death experience with a time of 43:13. If I want to predict what would be equivalent time I just increase time by 7%. This will be give me a time of 46:05 for the Men's Singles Level 3 Competitive! So if in the end I finish with a time of 45:59, I'll be happy that I beat equivalent time, rather than sad that I was almost 3 minutes slower than last year! </p>\r\n\r\n        <h4 class=\"mt-4\">Women's Level 2 (Intermediate) vs. '24 Open</h4>\r\n        <figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">\r\n            <img src=\"/blog/image/redline-25-time-predictions-a-data-driven-forecast-for-singles-events/thumb_Figure3_blog.png\" alt=\"Women's Level 2 vs 2024 Open Changes\">\r\n            <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 3: Changes for Women's Level 2.

The data suggests that the changes made to the Open -> Level 2 transition (+31% time increase) were more significant than the changes for Competitive -> Level 3 (+16%). We'll only know for sure on race day!</p>\r\n        <p>Another question is, will these percentage changes apply to the winners? Unfortunately, it's unlikely. Elite winners (and often those at the other end of the spectrum) are typically outliers whose performance doesn't always scale linearly with the average. These predictions are most useful if you're targeting a finish in the main pack (e.g., Top 30% or better) or if you competed last year and want a rough estimate of how your time might translate.</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n        <p>For more data analysis and to explore past results in detail, take a look around the Redline Results explorer. Use the data to set informed goals, but remember that on race day, anything can happen!</p>\r\n        <p>Thanks,<br>Steve.</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n</article>",
