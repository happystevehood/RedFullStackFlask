    "text": "<section>\r\n\t<p>The dust has settled, the sweat has dried, and the last of the DOMS is finally fading. Redline 2025 was an absolute monster of an event, and what a weekend it was! A few weeks ago, I put my data-driven neck on the line and published some predictions for the 2025 finish times. As the old saying goes, \"only a fool tries to predict the future\" and after seeing the actual results, I can confirm I\\u2019ve played the fool magnificently!</p>        \r\n\t<p>That weekend was diffenent than anyone anticipated, and my predictions, in some cases, weren't even close. But the goal of analyzing data isn't just to be right; it's to learn. So, let's eat some humble pie and break down what really happened.</p>    \r\n</section>    \r\n<section>        \r\n\t<h4>The Prediction Scorecard: Where I Went Wrong</h4>        \r\n\t<p>Let's start with the main event: my predictions versus the actual median results. As you can see below, the reality of race day was far more grueling than my spreadsheets suggested.</p>                \r\n\t<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">            \r\n\t\t<img src=\"/blog/image/my-redline-25-predictions-vs-the-brutal-reality-a-humble-debrief/thumb_Figure_1.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Prediction vs Actual Times for Redline '25\">            \r\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 1: My 2025 predictions versus the actual median times. The 'Diff Pred% V Act%' column shows the margin of error.</figcaption>        \r\n\t</figure>        \r\n\t<p>I have to admit, seeing a 20% difference in my Women's Doubles prediction stings a little! So where did the model break down?</p>        \r\n\t<p>For the <strong>new/modified stations</strong>, my estimations were off:</p>        \r\n\t<ul>            \r\n\t\t<li>I seriously <strong>underestimated</strong> the cumulative fatigue of the <strong>DB Burpees</strong> and <strong>Squat Thrusts</strong>. The sheer volume was a gut punch that the data couldn't fully anticipate.</li>            \r\n\t\t<li>Conversely, I <strong>overestimated</strong> the difficulty of the <strong>Russian Twists</strong>. It seems many athletes found a good rhythm and it was easier than I expected.</li>        \r\n\t</ul>        \r\n\t<p>For the <strong>existing stations</strong>, the story was similar:</p>        \r\n\t<ul>            \r\n\t\t<li>I <strong>underestimated</strong> the dreaded <strong>Sled Push & Pull</strong>. It remains the great equalizer and, for many, the ultimate maker or breaker of a race.</li>            \r\n\t\t<li>I <strong>overestimated</strong> the impact of the increased distance on the <strong>Farmer's Carry</strong>. It seems grip strength and sheer grit won the day here more than I expected, and the course was shorter than advertised too.</li>        \r\n\t</ul>        \r\n\t<p>But hey, at least I tried! And the process itself reveals some fascinating insights.</p>    \r\n</section>\r\n<section>        \r\n\t<h4>The Elite Anomaly: The Women's Advanced Shuttle Run</h4>        \r\n\t<p>This is where the data gets <em>really</em> interesting and highlights the incredible calibre of athletes at the top. Take a look at the comparison of the Run and Shuttle Run times.</p>        \r\n\t<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">            \r\n\t\t<img src=\"/blog/image/my-redline-25-predictions-vs-the-brutal-reality-a-humble-debrief/thumb_Figure2.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Comparison of Run and Shuttle Run times across events\">            \r\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 3: A comparison of Run and Shuttle Run times, highlighting the impressive performance of the Women's Advanced Singles.</figcaption>        \r\n\t</figure>        \r\n\t<p>Look closely at the Shuttle Runs. The Women's Advanced Singles athletes, on average, completed this station in <strong>6:01</strong>. This was faster than the median times for both the Men's Doubles (6:16) and Women's Doubles (6:08) teams!</p>        \r\n\t<p>How is this possible? While doubles teams can use a You-Go-I-Go strategy to rest, the top-tier singles athletes are relentlessly on the move. This data point is a testament to the incredible engine and conditioning of these competitors. The Women's Advanced athletes are, without a doubt, a class of their own. They are truly elite!</p>    \r\n</section>  \r\n<section>        \r\n\t<h4>A Station-by-Station Look at the Carnage</h4>        \r\n\t<p>When we look at the detailed breakdown of the median times for each station across all events, we can see which challenges truly defined the 2025 race.</p>        \r\n\t<figure class=\"figure text-center my-4\">            \r\n\t\t<img src=\"/blog/image/my-redline-25-predictions-vs-the-brutal-reality-a-humble-debrief/thumb_Figure3_blog.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Detailed Station Breakdown of Median Times for Redline '25\">            \r\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\">Figure 2: A breakdown of the ~Median Times for each station across the 2025 events.</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>        \r\n\t<p>Looking at the table, the new <strong>Shuttle Runs</strong> consistently emerged as the single longest station on average for most categories. The constant acceleration and deceleration over 40 reps was a massive test of conditioning.</p>        \r\n\t<p>However, the undisputed king of pain, the \\\"champion in a bad way,\\\" was the <strong>Sled Push & Pull</strong> in the Men's Advanced Singles, clocking in at a brutal 9:35. It's important to note that these times exclude competitors who only completed one round of the push and pull under the instructions of the Judges, but nevertheless got a +3:00 penalty.</p>    \r\n</section>    \r\n<section>        \r\n\t<h4>Conclusion</h4>        \r\n\t<p>So, while my crystal ball might be a bit cloudy, the 2025 data tells a clear story. The new movements tested our engines in unexpected ways, the Sled remains a beast, and the top athletes continue to push the boundaries of performance.</p>        \r\n\t<p>Diving into these numbers is a fantastic way to prepare for Bangkok 2025, or even KL 2026. Now we know: train for more volume, respect the Sled, and if you want to be the best, you have to be ready for absolutely anything.</p>        \r\n\t<p>Thanks for following along on this journey!</p>        \r\n\t<p>Steve</p>\r\n</section>    ",
