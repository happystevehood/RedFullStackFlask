    "text": "<p>With Redline Fitness Games 2025 just two months out, it's crunch time!&nbsp; Are you looking to fine-tune your strategy and make every training session count? At Redline Fitness Results, we believe in an evidence-based approach. Let's delve into the '24 Women's Doubles data to uncover actionable insights that can sharpen your 2025 performance.</p>\r\n<p>As we get closer to game day, practicing with the actual equipment and mimicking race-day station setups becomes crucial for efficiency and minimizing transition time. This analysis will help you prioritize which setups to replicate.</p>\r\n<p>(All the graphs shown below, and more for Women's Doubles '24, are available if you <a href=\"/display?eventname=WomensDoubles2024\">click here</a>, select 'Data Visualisation' and 'Displayed on webpage').</p>\r\n<h4>Where Did Athletes Spend the Most Time? ('24 Women's Doubles Average)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/unlock-your-redline-2025-24-women-s-doubles-data/thumb_WomensDoubles2024Pie_markup.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: '24 Women's Doubles Average Station Time Breakdown - <strong>click to expand</strong>\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 1: '24 Women's Doubles Average Station Time Breakdown</strong></p>\r\n<p>This pie chart from the '24 Women's Doubles shows where, on average, teams spent the bulk of their race. The top time consumers were:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Sandbag Gauntlet (11.8%):</strong> A significant chunk of time, highlighting its demanding nature.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Row (9.0%)</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Pendulum Shots (8.7%)</strong> - Note: This station is DROPPED for 2025.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>While Pendulum Shots are gone, understanding that Sandbag Gauntlet and Row were major time sinks is valuable. The '25 Sandbag Gauntlet remains, and the Row calorie targets have even increased from 30 to 35, in fact all the 'ergs have increased by 16.6%! &ndash; so these are still key areas to drill.</p>\r\n<h4>Identifying Game-Changer Stations; Time Spreads ('24 Women's Doubles)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/unlock-your-redline-2025-24-women-s-doubles-data/thumb_WomensDoubles2024Bar_markup.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: '24 Women's Doubles Bar Station Breakdown (Time Spread) - click to expand\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 2: '24 Women's Doubles Bar Station Breakdown (Time Spread)</strong></p>\r\n<p>This chart is crucial. The total height of each bar (and the difference between the fastest and slowest percentiles) shows the *spread* of times. Larger spreads mean more opportunity to gain (or lose) significant time.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Biggest Opportunities in '24:</strong> <strong>Sandbag Gauntlet</strong>, <strong>Deadball Burpee</strong>, and the now-dropped <strong>Pendulum Shots</strong> had the largest time variations. Improving your efficiency and capacity on stations like Sandbag Gauntlet and Deadball Burpee for '25 could yield massive returns.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Why this matters now:</strong> With only two months left, focusing on stations where big time improvements are possible (and which are still in '25) is a smart move. Practice these under fatigue and with an emphasis on smooth transitions.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>The Strongest Links to Overall Success ('24 Women's Doubles Correlation)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/unlock-your-redline-2025-24-women-s-doubles-data/thumb_WomensDoubles2024Corr_markup.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: '24 Women's Doubles Station Correlation with Total Time - click to expand\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 3: '24 Women's Doubles Station Correlation with Total Time</strong></p>\r\n<p>Which stations most reliably predicted a good overall finish in '24? This correlation chart tells the story.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Top Correlators ('24 Women's Doubles):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ski (0.87)</li>\r\n<li>Farmer's Carry (0.86)</li>\r\n<li>Sandbag Gauntlet (0.86)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Training Implication:</strong> Excelling at these highly correlated stations that *remain* in 2025 (Ski, Farmer's Carry, Sandbag Gauntlet) should be a top priority. Your performance here will likely have a major say in your final rank.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>Visualizing Impact &ndash; Ski Time vs. Overall Position ('24 Women's Doubles)</h4>\r\n<p><img src=\"/blog/image/unlock-your-redline-2025-24-women-s-doubles-data/thumb_WomensDoubles2024SandbagGauntletScat_markup.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: '24 Women's Doubles Ski Station Time vs. Overall Position - click to expand\" width=\"50%\" border=\"2\\\" /><strong>Figure 4: '24 Women's Doubles Ski Station Time vs. Overall Position (Corr. 0.87)</strong></p>\r\n<p>This scatter plot (Figure 4) for the Ski station beautifully illustrates the strong correlation. Faster ski times (left side of the graph) generally led to better (lower) overall positions. The clear diagonal trend means being quick on the SkiErg was a huge advantage. With increased calorie targets for '25 in many categories, its importance is only amplified.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Key Training Adjustments for Redline 2025 (Women's Categories):</h4>\r\n<p>Considering the '24 data and the '25 station changes (Agility Chamber, Pendulum Shots, Battle Whip OUT; Russian Twists, Squat Thrusts, Shuttle Runs IN):</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Master Remaining High-Impact Stations:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sandbag Gauntlet:</strong> Still a major time component and significant spread. Practice the squats and lunges with competition weight.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Deadball Burpees:</strong> The '25 version (1m throw, no target) needs specific practice for flow and efficiency. Reps have increased!</li>\r\n<li><strong>Farmer's Carry:</strong> Distance has increased! (e.g., Women's Doubles 240m from '24). Build that grip and carrying endurance.</li>\r\n<li><strong>SkiErg:</strong> Still a kingmaker. Higher calorie targets mean more time under tension.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Mule:</strong> With Farmer's Carry being highly correlated in '24, expect The Mule (sandbag runs) to be similarly critical. Train varied sandbag carries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare for the New Trio:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Russian Twists:</strong> Core strength and stability. Practice with a wallball, focusing on controlled taps.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Squat Thrusts:</strong> Full-body conditioning. Focus on explosive hip movement and consistent pacing. And don't forget to breath</li>\r\n<li><strong>Shuttle Runs:</strong> Agility, acceleration, deceleration, and conditioning. Practice the 20m turn-touch-go format.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Equipment Familiarity is Non-Negotiable:</strong> With two months left, get hands-on with actual sandbags, deadballs, kettlebells, and ergs. Simulate station layouts and transitions in your gym if possible. This reduces fumbling and saves precious seconds on race day.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h5>Final Push: Train Smart!</h5>\r\n<p>The next two months are vital. Use the data on <a href=\"/display?eventname=WomensDoubles2024\">Redline Results</a> to see where you can make strategic gains. Focus on the high-impact stations, drill the new movements, and get comfortable with the race equipment and flow.</p>\r\n<p>Questions or specific data requests?
